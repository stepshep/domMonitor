Dear Rep Adam B. Schiff,

I am writing to ask you to support students, borrowers, and their families and commit to take action on student debt and college affordability. 

This week marks the third anniversary of “1T Day,” the day student loan debt in America passed $1 trillion.  Despite the explosive increase in student debt, which now surpasses credit card and auto debt combined, there has not been meaningful action to address the student debt crisis. 

I am asking that you commit to do the following to address the student debt crisis: 
• restore state and federal funding to higher education, implement policies like free community college, and hold colleges accountable to keep costs down while providing students a high-quality college education;
• reduce the existing $1.3 trillion in outstanding student debt by supporting borrowers and passing policies like student loan refinancing and protecting programs that help borrowers pay back their debt without financial hardship; and 
• stop Wall Street’s exploitation of students and borrowers by holding those that profit off of the higher education system, like for-profit colleges and student loan servicers, accountable. 

Please express your support for these principles publicly on the floor of Congress, or post your support on Facebook Twitter like this:  "I commit to act for students and borrowers and help make higher ed an affordable reality for all. pic.twitter.com/NvxCY8KDcd #DebtSrikesBack"
